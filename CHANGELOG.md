# Changelog

All notable changes to the skills in this repository. Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) per skill.

## Unreleased

### Added

- **dashboard-upgrade 2.0.0**, the third recipe: upgrades a dashboard or back office built for one operator into a reliable, premium tool. Reliability first (money and action bugs with tests, a hotfix PR when production is broken), shared foundations (a form sheet that never loses input, one data table, coded errors the operator can report), screens shaped around the operator's day, one signature moment, and verification in a real browser and against a local database. Version 1 was a private skill; 2.0 names its public reference implementation ([jnaninyoga/dashboard](https://github.com/jnaninyoga/dashboard)), adds the 9/10 rule, a feedback decoder, evals and a README.

### Changed

- **site-upgrade**, from a yoga studio redesign where the owner rejected a hero that scored 8.7 from screenshots: a feel gate (the owner scrolls the first screen before the rest is built); discovery starts with the brand file and the owner's other products; scroll never drives video frames, pinned scenes stay near two screens, and no generated sound; people come from real footage and logos are never redrawn; the 404's idea goes in the direction contract; new critique caps, gotchas, owner-feedback rows, a trail-map recipe and WebGL-scene recipes. A film the visitor watches now gets its own player, with a timeline built from what the film is about, instead of the browser default.
- **site-upgrade**, from the same studio after launch: phone layouts are checked at the heights real phone browsers leave; a signature the visitor can do gets its own page, a door on the home page and the 404 (a new building block); pinned scenes need a clean stop and threshold hand-overs; sound made in the browser for experiences the visitor starts; recipes for a real sky, noise to clarity, depth from the brand's geometry and a scroll sensor; one pause control for everything that moves; owner-feedback rows and approvals; and new gotchas (cropped marks, scrollbars in generated images, `@property`, non-scaling strokes and draw-ins, partial staging, Cloudflare preview aliases).
- **site-upgrade** tools: `sprite-from-video.py` cuts a walking person out of footage into a sticker sprite; `page-audit.js` reports descenders running into the next block and captions drifting off their pictures; `slop-scan` adds `scroll-scrub` and `generated-audio`.
- The collection is now **tebzira** (Marrakchi Darija for spices, and a cook's blend): the repo is `vvhybe/tebzira`, the plugin marketplace is `tebzira` (`/plugin install site-upgrade@tebzira`), and each skill is presented as a recipe. Skill names are unchanged; GitHub redirects the old URL.

### Docs

- New banners for the collection and every recipe, drawn from the vintage porcelain tea set of a Marrakchi home: banded rims with gold ribbons and flower cartouches, a rust lattice, an iron-red roundel with the eight-point star, the spices as glazes.
- Each skill has its own README (showcase, how it works, install, tools), with its media under `docs/<skill>/`. The root README presents the collection.

## dev-guide 2.0.0 (2026-11-03)

The second skill: a developer guide for any repository, written as a learning book and typeset as one. Version 1 was a private skill built on three related repositories; its instructions had been truncated and its references lost, so 2.0 reconstructs them from the guides it produced and generalizes the pipeline.

### Added

- **Publisher-grade covers.** A public-domain plate (engraving, technical or botanical plate) printed in one ink above a panel in the volume's colour, set in EB Garamond, with a series line and volume number. `find_plate.py` searches open collections and records each plate's credit; `make_cover.py` cleans old scans to the cover's paper and previews the cover in seconds. The credit prints on the back cover.
- **Series.** Sibling repositories become volumes of one series.
- **A cover image** next to the PDF, for READMEs and link previews; the Word edition opens on the same cover.
- **References** for research, writing (Diátaxis, the chapter anatomy, callouts, quizzes, diagrams), the cover, and build and verification. **Templates** for the config, home page, chapter and glossary.
- `DEV_GUIDE_OUT` to build previews without touching the repository; evals; cover regression tests.
- **Safe builds of untrusted repositories:** one parser-based enforcement pass over the finished book (tag and attribute allowlists, every fetchable URL confined to the guide, the skill's assets and the work dir, no attachments), a WeasyPrint fetcher with the same limits and no network, outputs confined to the repository, cover colours and plate paths validated, and every config or page-derived string escaped.

### Changed

- The Word edition no longer needs PrinceXML: figures rasterize with WeasyPrint and poppler.
- The Word builder is `build_docx.cjs`, so it runs inside projects whose `package.json` sets `"type": "module"`.
- The illustrated cover styles are gone, replaced by the plate and type styles.
- Montserrat's licence text now ships with the fonts.

## site-upgrade 2.0.0 (2026-11-03)

The first public release. Version 1 was a private skill distilled from one marketing-site upgrade; 2.0 folds in two more projects (a B2B company site taken through two full directions, and a help center built from scratch), every piece of owner feedback from all three, and ideas from the best open design skills.

### Added

- **Surface modes:** Persuade (product and company sites), Read (help centers, docs, changelogs) and Experience (portfolios), each with its own rules. New `read-mode.md`.
- **The idea sentence and the competitor test** in `direction.md`, with examples from shipped sites; a single "live thing" per site; palette by color theory (temperature contrast, 60/30/10, accents with one job).
- **The direction contract** template, written before code and audited in the critique.
- **The 9/10 rule** and a scored critique with caps and a written round format (`critique.md`, `assets/templates/critique-round.md`).
- **`tells.md`:** a dated registry of what reads as generated, with an explicit rule for earned exceptions that come from the brand.
- **`feedback.md`:** a decoder from what owners say ("not enough spice", "colors out of balance", "cheap replica") to what to change.
- **`three-d.md`:** when 3D earns its place, the source ladder (owner's model, procedural reconstruction, generators), the exactness gate, a headless Blender to glTF pipeline and runtime rules.
- **`slop-scan.mjs`:** a zero-dependency source scanner for tells, invented proof, genre copy, dead links, secrets and known traps, with named exceptions.
- **`page-audit.js`:** an in-browser frame check (one h1, heading length, small text, tap targets, unnamed controls, untitled sections, browser surfaces).
- **Templates:** claims ledger, direction contract, critique round, DESIGN.md, team update.
- B2B building blocks: catalog with real logos and lead prefill, problem-to-answer illustrations, honest comparison, own booking UI. Pricing presentation, changelog page, Experience mode notes.
- Media: device-frame compositing, brand-logo CDN gotchas, QR codes with a logo done properly, protecting proprietary assets.
- SEO: 2026 updates (FAQ rich results retired, real per-page lastmod, preview noindex), static exports on Cloudflare Pages, after-launch steps.
- Delivery: the before/after report, DESIGN.md at the end, repo hygiene.
- Evals, a repo validator, regression tests and CI.

### Changed

- The skill is self-contained: every recipe it needs is in its references, with original snippets, instead of pointers into a private reference repo.
- `ssr-audit.sh` also checks the canonical link and `og:image` per page.
- `ScrollTriggerRefresh.tsx` rewritten without template-specific references.
