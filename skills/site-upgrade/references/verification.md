# Verification

Look at everything you build in a real browser before you claim it works. Screenshots are for judgment, scripted checks are for facts, and the critique (critique.md) turns judgment into a score.

## 1. Kickoff: baseline and before captures

- Start the dev server and note the real port.
- Copy the Playwright scripts into the workspace once: `mkdir -p .playwright-mcp && cp <skill>/scripts/playwright/*.js .playwright-mcp/`, and make sure `.playwright-mcp/` is git-ignored.
- Capture the **before** set: each page at 1440×900 and 390×844, full page after `reveal-scroll.js`. The after set later uses the same viewports, so the report compares like with like.
- When capturing a live site, block analytics hosts first so the captures don't send hits, and dismiss the consent card:

  ```js
  await page.route(/(clarity\.ms|googletagmanager|google-analytics|cloudflareinsights|bing\.com)/, (r) => r.abort());
  ```

## 2. The loop for each section

1. Load the page.
2. Run `reveal-scroll.js` (as the `filename` of `browser_run_code_unsafe`).
3. Scroll the section into view and wait out its animation.
4. Screenshot it, then **look at it** with the Read tool. Fix what's off, and batch fixes before the next look rather than screenshotting after every tweak.

To capture one section without a fixed navbar over it, add `[data-shot-hide]{display:none!important}` in a style tag, set `data-shot-hide` on the bar, then take the element screenshot.

## 3. Widths, themes and preferences

Check every section in each of these:

- **Widths:** 1440 (desktop), **1920×710** (a short laptop window; it exposes bottom-of-page reveal bugs), 390 and 320 (phones). Add 768 when the layout changes there.
- **Phone heights:** a 390×844 viewport has none of a phone browser's toolbars. Also run 375×553 (an SE in Safari), 360×640, 393×660 and 402×756, and measure the clearances between the headline, the mark and the call to action (gotchas.md § Rendering and layout). An owner's phone screenshot is the test you failed.
- **Themes:** light and dark if the site has both (set the stored theme, then reload).
- **Reduced motion:** `page.emulateMedia({ reducedMotion: 'reduce' })`. Intro targets must be visible, no video may autoplay, tiles and counters show their end state.
- **Languages:** every locale's home page and one inner page, looking for overflow from longer words.

## 4. Scripted checks

- **`page-audit.js`** on each page and at 390: one `<h1>`, headings over two lines, text under 12 px, tap targets under 40×40 at phone width, controls without an accessible name, images without `alt`, sections without a heading, and whether the browser surfaces (selection, scrollbar, caret, accent) are themed.
- **`overflow.js`** on each page: `scrollWidth − clientWidth` and the offending elements per width.
- **`reveal-scroll.js`**: text still hidden after a full scroll is a reveal that failed.
- **`console-scan.js`** on a production server: console errors, page errors, failed requests, 4xx/5xx and CSP violations across every sitemap page.
- **`slop-scan.mjs`** on the source: tells, invented proof, genre copy, dead links. Every remaining finding is either fixed or an earned exception with a `site-upgrade-allow` comment.
- **`ssr-audit.sh`** on a production server: server-rendered pages, one `<h1>`, canonical, social image, headers, crawler files.

## 5. Interactions and APIs

- Check real state, not only pixels: the video's `currentTime` and `paused` after clicking a chapter; a live region's text after changing a quantity; which values flashed after one edit; the prefilled field after arriving from the catalog.
- **Auto-advance:** leave the page alone and log the active chapter and `currentTime` every second for 25 s.
- **API branches:** call `fetch('/api/...')` from inside the page; fake responses with `page.route`.
- **Keyboard:** tab through the page; every control reachable in reading order with a visible focus ring; the menu closes on Escape; galleries respond to arrow keys.

## 6. Production builds without breaking the dev server

`next build` and a running `next dev` share `.next/`, and the build knocks out the dev server. Build in an isolated copy instead:

```bash
B=<scratchpad>/prodcheck && rm -rf "$B" && mkdir -p "$B"
rsync -a --exclude={node_modules,.next,out,dist,.git,.playwright-mcp} ./ "$B"/   # the working tree, uncommitted changes included
cp -a node_modules "$B/node_modules"            # Turbopack refuses a symlink that leaves its root; webpack accepts one
cp .env "$B/.env" 2>/dev/null || true     # when the build reads env values (prices, store URLs)
(cd "$B" && ./node_modules/.bin/next build && nohup ./node_modules/.bin/next start -p 3100 > ../prod.log 2>&1 &)
```

- Call the framework binary directly in the copy. With a symlinked `node_modules`, a package manager run there may rewrite the shared `.bin` wrappers with the copy's path (pnpm does), which breaks the repo once the copy is gone.
- After adding a dependency, `rsync -a --delete node_modules/ "$B/node_modules/"`.
- For a static export, serve `out/` instead (`npx serve out -l 3100`, or the host's local runner for Functions).
- **Stopping it:** find the PID by port (`ss -ltnp | grep :3100`) and kill that. `pkill -f` patterns can match your own shell's command line and kill it. The framework's server child keeps the port too; if a restart fails with `EADDRINUSE`, kill it as well, or you'll be testing the old build.
- When rechecking a rebuilt static site, the browser may serve cached HTML heuristically. Disable the cache or add a `?v=` query.

## 7. Platform checks

- **iPhone Safari:** reload the page and check that the status bar keeps the page's color (gotchas.md § iOS status bar).
- **Bot checks:** headless browsers don't get Turnstile tokens on production hosts. Test the form end to end on localhost, or ask the owner to submit once from their browser.
- **Functions:** run the host's local runner against the production build (for Cloudflare Pages: `npx wrangler pages dev out`) to exercise middleware, redirects and API routes with the production CSP.
- **Deploy previews:** after pushing, wait for the preview build (`gh pr checks <n>`) and open it. A transient "failed to publish Functions" after assets uploaded is often a host-side hiccup; retry the deployment once before changing code.
- **`wrangler pages dev` hangs when `out/` is rebuilt under it.** Stop it first. Its `workerd` children keep the port, so find them by process or start on a new port.
- **`wrangler pages dev` ignores Range requests.** Video seeking can't be tested there; use a small Range-aware server, or the deploy preview.

## 8. Before every commit

- The repo's lint, type check and format command, and a production build, all pass.
- Remove `.playwright-mcp/` artifacts from the repo root; the MCP writes snapshots there.
- Scan the staged diff for secrets, tokens and env files (only `.env.example` is committed).
- Stage specific files. Owners keep local drafts in the repo root; `git add -A` sweeps them in.

## 9. Feel, which screenshots can't show

- The owner feels it (direction.md § 10). Your tools can prove it works; they can't prove it feels good.
- **Trust no frame rate until you have a baseline.** The Playwright MCP browser can run `requestAnimationFrame` near 2 fps on ordinary pages. Measure `example.com` first. One session reported a site bug that was the test browser.
- **For real timing,** launch your own Chromium from the `playwright-core` in the npx cache: `chromium.launch({ headless: true, args: ['--disable-frame-rate-limit'] })`. Hold gestures, timed reveals and transitions only behave there.
- **For WebGL,** use `--use-angle=swiftshader --enable-webgl --ignore-gpu-blocklist --enable-unsafe-swiftshader` and drop the frame-limit flag, or screenshots time out. Software rendering proves correctness, never smoothness. Say so in the report.
- **Count the scroll.** Wheel ticks from the first screen to the first new content. More than about 15 is too many.
- **List where the visitor can stop.** In every pinned or scroll-driven scene, screenshot each position a visitor might rest on, including just before and after each hand-over. A half-blended frame at rest is a defect (gotchas.md § Motion and media).
- **Speed up timed experiences** instead of waiting them out: an init script that scales `performance.now()` and the `requestAnimationFrame` timestamp by 30 runs a one-minute sequence in two seconds.
- **Sound can't be heard here.** Check that the `AudioContext` is running after the click and that the mute toggle's state and stored choice are right; the owner listens on a device.
